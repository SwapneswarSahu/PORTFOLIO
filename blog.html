                        <h2>Learn C/C++ - in fun way!</h2>
                        <p>C++ is where my development journey began!
From writing simple programs to solving complex DSA problems on LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank, I've honed my skills in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

With C++, I've also developed real-world mini projects like:

🛒 Supermarket Management System – to handle inventory, billing, and product management.

🏥 Hospital Management System – to manage patient records, doctor info, and appointment scheduling.

🎮 Snake Game – simple interactive game using console interface.

🧮 Scientific Calculator – supports basic to advanced calculations.

I love C++ for its speed, power, and flexibility, especially in system-level programming and competitive coding.

                        <h2>Learn HTML,CSS,JAVAScript - in fun way!</h2>
                        <p>HTML was my first step into the world of web development. It introduced me to how websites are structured and how content is displayed on the internet. I started by building basic web pages and soon moved on to interactive front-end designs by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 What I Learned in HTML:
Page structuring with semantic tags

Linking pages & resources

Embedding multimedia (images, videos, audio)

Forms, tables, and layout design

Integrating with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced interactivity

🔧 Projects Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

                        <h2>Learn SQL & MySQL - in fun way!</h2>
                        <p>🗃️ SQL & MySQL – My Journey with Databases
                        Every app, website, and system needs a database to store and manage its data. That's where SQL (Structured Query
                        Language) comes in — it's the backbone of managing data efficiently.
                        I’ve worked with MySQL and Oracle SQL tools to create, manage, and query relational databases in my projects.
